==============

Map rips from classic Bullfrog game Syndicate (1993).

All 50 levels. Map numbers and names are from the .dat files coming with the game.

Ripped using [FreeSynd](http://freesynd.sourceforge.net) + some elbow grease.

The images have been optimized using ImageOptim, but are still ~1MB each.
